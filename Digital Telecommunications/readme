As you can read in assignment (in greek) it consists of two parts.
Part A is about simulating and studying of M-PAM system output.
Part B is about discrete source encoding using DPCM method.

In order to test the code you should have a [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) version installed.
